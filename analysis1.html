  <h2>Insights</h2>
  <h3 class="subheader">Key Indicators</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Cumulative Sales: <b>269K</b> worth of drugs sold with <b>£71.31M</b> in revenue and <b>81.97%</b> profit margin indicates excellent profitability.</li>
    <li>Good revenue to cost ratio indicating controlled costs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Trends Over Time</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Monthly Sales Pattern: Revenue and expenses were steady but spiked during January, July, & September.</li>
    <li>Profit remained consistent due to proportional cost structure.</li>
    <li>These peaks may reflect seasonal demand or promotional campaigns.</li>
    <li>The most profitable year by a wide margin was <b>2023</b> with sales close to <b>£62M</b> and monthly average of <b>£5M</b> as against 
        other years with sales lower than £4M and monthly average lower than £500K.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Product (Drugs) Performance</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Chronic/essential medications (like Doxycycline, Ergocalciferol and Lisinopril) led in revenue contribution.</li>
    <li>Majority of the buyers of the top performing drugs are resellers(e.g.,hospitals, distributors or pharmacies).
        They likely have efficient ordering processes, strong relationships with NovaMed,or serve high-demand markets.</li>
    <li>Top 5 drugs weren’t constant on a year-on-year basis.</li>
    <li>Warfarin remained the least performing drug over the years in revenue contribution.</li>
    <li>The top five performing drugs are classed 2, 3, 4, and 5 under the regulatory compliance group.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Customer Performance</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>David Johnson & Bob Williams were the top customers with revenue contributions and appear multiple times,signifying high-value 
        repeat customers.</li>
    <li>Revenue was concentrated around a few high-value customers: Top 10 customers contributed <b>45%</b> to the total revenue, a potential 
        risk if they churn.</li>
    <li>Under performing customers may face logistical issues, financial constraints, or reduced market reach. This could also indicate a need 
        for targeted support or reassessment of business relationships.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Customer – Revenue Relationship</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Market penetration was strongest in Australia & Canada regions evidenced in revenue generated.</li>
    <li>"Sellers" generated significantly higher average revenue (£4K) compared to "Users" (£0.1K), highlighting the 
        profitability of the seller channel.</li>
    <li>Heavy reliance on distributors or resellers.</li>
    <li>Adults and Middle Age groups contributed the most revenue, with females driving higher revenue than males across all age groups.</li>
    <li>Elder & Youth segments showed lower revenue, possibly due to lower purchasing power or demand.</li>
    <li>Buyer Type: 73% Seller, 27% User, reinforcing the heavy reliance on sellers.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

    <div class="section">
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <h3 class="subheader">Optimize Product Portfolio</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Continuously improve and develop top performing drugs to maintain market-edge & conduct a
        review of bottom performing with the possibility of phasing them out or improving their market
        positioning.</li>
  </ul><h3 class="subheader">Enhance Customer Engagement</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Strengthen relationships with top-performing customers by offering incentives & tailored support to
        sustain loyalty while providing training, financial assistance, or logistical support to improve the
        performance of bottom-performing ones.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Resource Allocation</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Redirect marketing and sales resources toward high-potential drugs and customers, while reducing
        investment in underperforming areas unless turnaround strategies show promise.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Market Expansion</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Leverage the strong performance in regions like Australia & Canada by increasing marketing efforts
        and exploring adjacent markets with similar demographics. Investigate underperforming regions
        (e.g., outside the top two) to identify barriers and potential growth opportunities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="subheader">Channel Optimization</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Strengthen partnerships with sellers, who are the primary revenue drivers, by offering incentives or
        exclusive deals to maintain their dominance. Explore ways to increase direct sales to users (e.g.,
        online platforms or loyalty programs) to diversify revenue streams and reduce reliance on sellers.</li>
